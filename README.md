## IDEA:
- INPUT: SRC, DEST, Depots (list)
- STANDARD DATA: Google API (place -> lat, long)
    - Depot - frequency of item deliveries; traffic
    - Cost  - freight weight (balancing load) and transportation cost
    - Distance - time => cost factor 1
    - Delivery urgency - priority based (Time window penalty cost)
    - Fuel efficiency, Carbon emissions
    - Freshness degradation (for cold logistics alone)
    - Road, traffic, weather
    - Vehicle conditions
    - Driving hours and rest
    - (Fleet management)
    - Energy use
    - Safety and security
    - Economic Health
    - Ecosystem impacts
 - Factors:  
    - Depot:
        Frequencies of item-calculated from dataset using DepotId
        Used for quick transport of goods
        Frequent depot-> delivery started as and when the orders are placed
        Less frequent depot-> delivery process must wait until some amt -> reached.

    - Cost:


    - Distance and time:
          Optimal path -> less distance and less time.

    - Delivery urgency:
          If an order needs urgent delivery(Ex: amazon prime subscribers vs normal users),
          routing must be planned accordingly. cost -> increase


    - Fuel efficiency, carbon emissions:
          (is there any cnxn bw traffic condition and fuel efficiency?)
          Suggest route which decrease the carbon emissions.
          and same with fuel efficiency.

    - Freshness Degradation:
          When the order is veggies,..
          consider the time

    - Road, Traffic and weather:
          Main problem is we have to get real time data for predicting the current traffics, weather and road condition.

    - Vehicle conditions:
          Depends on the size of vehicle. if it is a big truck, we can only suggest highways....

    - Driving hours and rest:
          Consider rest time

     - Safety and security:
          may be we can consider the safety of the goods ( type of goods)
          Packaging cost 

     - Economic health:
     - Ecosystem impacts:
          similiar to carbon emissions

     - Capacity of the vehicle


IP:
Set of orders
and also factors

OP:
Total cost after considering the factors and
Optimal path

(Hierarchy)


- OUTPUT: Routes + time factor => best k solutions
- METHODOLOGY: Equation based on all factors - try to optimise the score 

- Challenges 
- IDEA: diverse adaption for any country based on standard data
- IDEA: SPARK DISTRIBUTED processing 
1. Finalise mode: Air route, ship route, road route ; or mixed mode
2. Finalise scope: India or US or specific country; 
worldwide, intercontinent


---
1. Identify more factors 
2. Find equation


---


## To decide:
1. Route optimise --- > existing route => optimise
2. Graph dataset => 
3. Lat and Longitude
3. Distributed data.... spark

4. Maximise delivery
Minimise time
Minimise cost

-- > dataset depend
